# weather-geocoder

### A telegram bot that receives all the information from your location. Shows the full address of your location and the weather at your point.

Reverse geocoding identiÔ¨Åes locations nearest to a latitude and longitude coordinate, enabling increased reliability of the location data.

I used a completely **free** library for geocoding and reverse geocoding - **geocoder**. One of the best solutions for creating such a program.
Since almost all analogues are paid, or require a subscription.

To display the weather in the selected area used a **free** open source service - **Open Weather Map**.
OWM provides a detailed picture of the current weather in the selected city.
